Hobbyist programmer who somehow always has three projects open and zero finished. I like building things just to figure out how they work, then rebuilding them “better” instead of shipping.

Big fan of the C language family (C, C++, C#) because I enjoy having just enough control to break everything myself. I spend a lot of time messing with Web APIs, backend logic, and systems stuff that probably didn’t need to be reinvented but now exists anyway.

Time management is… theoretical. I’ll optimize something that isn’t even in production yet. But when a project clicks, I lock in hard.

Mostly here to learn, build cool stuff, and slowly turn side projects into something real.
